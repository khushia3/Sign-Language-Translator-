# **Speech-to-Sign Language Translator**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a **Speech-to-Sign Language Translator** that converts spoken words into sign language representations using **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision**. It helps bridge the communication gap between spoken and sign language users.  

## **Features**  
- Converts **spoken language** to corresponding **sign language gestures**.  
- Uses **speech recognition** to process voice input.  
- Displays sign language gestures in real-time.  
- Implements **deep learning models** for accurate sign detection.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- OpenCV  
- Google Speech Recognition API  
- NLP (Natural Language Processing)  
- MediaPipe / YOLO (for gesture detection)  

## **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/Speech-to-Sign-Language-Translator.git
   cd Speech-to-Sign-Language-Translator
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  

## **Usage**  
1. Speak into the microphone.  
2. The system will **recognize** the speech and convert it to text.  
3. It will **map the text** to sign language gestures.  
4. The corresponding **sign language images or animations** will be displayed.
