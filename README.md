Speech-to-Sign Language Translator
Overview
This project is a Speech-to-Sign Language Translator that converts spoken words into sign language representations using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision. It helps bridge the communication gap between spoken and sign language users.

Features
Converts spoken language to corresponding sign language gestures.
Uses speech recognition to process voice input.
Displays sign language gestures in real-time.
Implements deep learning models for accurate sign detection.
Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / PyTorch
OpenCV
Google Speech Recognition API
NLP (Natural Language Processing)
MediaPipe / YOLO (for gesture detection)
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/Speech-to-Sign-Language-Translator.git
cd Speech-to-Sign-Language-Translator
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Usage
Speak into the microphone.
The system will recognize the speech and convert it to text.
It will map the text to sign language gestures.
The corresponding sign language images or animations will be displayed.
